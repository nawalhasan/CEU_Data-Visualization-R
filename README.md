# Data Visualization with R

This repository is dedicated to all the assignments Data Visualization with R. In this hands-on course, I learnt more about data munging and preparations for data visualization: mastering ggplot2, the R implementation of the Grammar of Graphics. Besides creating and customizing static plots, I also learnt about integrating these outputs in automated or ad-hoc reports, with a short introduction into interactive dashboards as well.

# Course Content:

1. Recap on ggplot2, MDS, scaling variables, Simpsonâ€™s Paradox, introduction to data.table
2. Clustering, animated plots, Anscombe's quartett, geocoding and basic maps
3. Boxplot, data transformations, visualization themes, interactive plots
